Since categories can be seen as objects in a higher-order category, all of them need just\ntwo main language constructions: types and values, introduced and explained in this section.\nTypes and Values\nThe very fundamental concept of a Cation language is type. Each type is a category in itself.\nContravariantly, a category in Cation language is named type.\n\n    Types in Cation are declared using a type keyword followed by a type name:\n    \n\nThis is a full and sufficient definition of what type is; everything else about types in Cation and Cation\nitself are just consequences of this definition. For instance, saying that Cation is a language of operations\nwith types defines Cation as a categorical language.\nImportant to note that all Cation types are small categories and can be represented as finite sets, inhabited by their\nvalues. Hence, a value in Cation is an object in one of the type categories.\n\n    Values are defined using val keyword followed by an optional type annotation and a literal or an\n    expression which evaluation results in the value from the type:\n    \n\nAs all small categories can be seen as objects in the category of all small categories $\\mathbf{Cat}$,\nall Cation types as categories may also be seen as objects in a category of all types of Cation language –\n$\\mathbf{Cation}$. As a category, $\\mathbf{Cation}$ is small category with infinite number of members.\nExpressions, functions, programs\nA Cation expression maps a type ($A$) (named argument type) to a type\n($R$) (named return type: it can be the same as the argument type, or a different type).\nThus, an expression in Cation is always a functor $F: A \\rightarrow R$.\n\n    One can guess that an expression can also be seen as a morphism in the $\\mathbf{Cation}$.\n\nEvaluation of an expression selects a value ($a$) from the argument type ($A$)\nand maps it to another value ($r$) in the return type ($R$). Thus, it is an application\nof the functor ($F$) of the expression to an object ($a$):\n$$\\mathsf{eval}\\ F\\ a \\doteqdot a \\xrightarrow{F} r$$\n\n    Cation uses syntax close to math notation: a function type and expression evaluation are written as\n    \n    You can even use Cation compiler to prove that `r` has the type `R`:\n    \n\nThe signature of an expression $F: A \\rightarrow R$ is a type by itself: this is a function type. It\ncan also be defined via the evaluation, as shown above, applied to all objects of the argument category:\n$$F\\ a = r \\in R\\ |\\ \\forall a \\in A$$\nIn Cation, each function is a named expression – and each expression is a function (which maybe anonymous).\nAll expressions and functions are\n\nfunctors,\nmorphisms in $\\mathbf{Cation}$,\nobjects in $\\mathrm{hom}(\\mathbf{Cation})$\n\n\n    Named functions are defined from expressions\n\nor, with a multi-line syntax,\n\n\nA Cation program is a composition of expressions, which is an expression itself (as a composition of\nfunctors is always a functor). Execution of program corresponds to an evaluation of the expression: an\napplication of the composed functor to a program argument giving a result.\nData types\nData types is another example of Cation types, such that data types are the first-class language citizen\nalongside functions and expressions.\nThere are only two foundational data types, named unit and uninhabited. Unit type is an initial object\nin the $\\mathbf{Cation}$ category and is written as (,). Uninhabited type is a terminal object in the\n$\\mathbf{Cation}$ category and is written as (|). All other data types are derived from these two types via ... yes,\nexpressions!\n\n    As will be seen later, unit and uninhabited types are just empty product and co-product types\n\nData type is defined as an expression composition of other types. As with any algebraic data type system there are two\nforms of composition: product and co-product.\n\n    Here, we are taking advantage of all Cation types being small categories and thus sets; so a cartesian product\n    and unit operations over two types can be always defined in terms of sets.\n\nProduct data types are bi-functors from categories representing types $L$ and $R$ to a new category $P$; where\n$P$ is a cartesian product of sets of $L$ and $R$ objects: $P \\doteqdot L \\times R$. This also defines two\nprojections as functors from the type $P$ to the original types $L$ and $R$. Cation expresses product with a\ncomma operator (,) and the new type may be defined in the following way:\n\n\nIn fact, this is a syntactic sugar: data is a macro coming with the standard library, which expends into\nthis code, defining type, constructor function and two projections:\n\n\nCo-product data types are bi-functors corresponding to the morphism in the $\\mathbf{Cation^\\mathrm{op}}$: they\nmap a union of sets representing all possible values in $L$ and $R$ to a new category $S$: $S \\doteqdot L + R$. Cation\nunion with a pipe operator (|) and the new type may be defined in the following way:\n\n\nAgain, this is a syntactic sugar for\n\n\nAdvanced topics\nCurrying\nSince each data type constructor is a functor, and each functor takes exactly one argument, the multi-argument function\ntype type fn: A, B -&gt; C can be seen as a functor of a single argument of an unnamed product type (A, B) – or as a\ncomposition of two unnamed functors type fn: A -&gt; (B -&gt; C) – similar to the Haskell language.\nLambda expressions\nCollections\nGenerics\nNow it is time to introduce Cation language constructs build using the last component of the Category theory:\nnatural transformations.\nMonads\nExpert topics\nHere we show how all language constructs can be interpreted as natural transformations, such that their composability\nproperties are used for terminal analysis and parallel computations without creation of racing conditions.\nNaturality conditions\nTermination analysis\nRho expressions\n","id":"https://cation-lang.org/category/","title":""},"https://cation-lang.org/design/":{"body":"Cation Language Design\nWe design Cation as a pure categorical programming language for practical tasks.\nIn real-world computing, unlike mathematics, everything is bounded: resources, computational time; there are no\ninfinities, no arbitrary-precision rational or irrational numbers (but just their partial estimates). Most of existing\nprogramming languages ignored this simple fact, resulting in hundreds of pitfalls and footguns for the developers.\nCation tries to avoid this, and ensures that everything is bound and measurable at compile-time. It does this using\ninstruments of category theory, and as a result each Cation program can pass a termination analysis and formally\nprove maximum amount of resources it takes to execute.\nLanguage features\nCation is made for practical tasks: we attempt to make it easy-to-read and write, avoiding as much of boilerplate code\nas possible. There are just five built-in keywords; monadic programming is effortless: one does not need to declare set\nof possible error types ahead. Cation has indentation-based syntax, which makes it much more visually readable and sets\nit aside from curly-braced languages like C/C++, Rust, Scala... and makes it similar to Idris, Haskell, Python.\nIt has the following distinguishing features, which taken together set it aside from other existing languages:\n\nTermination analysis and eager evaluation, implying compile-time-defined bounds for data types\nGeneralized algebraic data types and dependent types\nSupport of metaprogramming with @-attributes operating like macros\nParallel computation by default (\"multi-way computing\")\nDoesn't require a runtime, doesn't use a garbage collector\nData types, functions and variable instances have no difference: everything is an expression\nEach expression corresponds to a natural transformation\nProgram compilation is an evaluation of expressions\nDesigned for the creation of domain-specific languages\n\nMutability and racing conditions\nThere are no variables, just values.\nException handling\nMemory addressing\nProgram structure\n\n  Since every statement is evaluated during compilation to expressions, everything is an expression, and each expression\n  resolves to a natural transformation. Natural transformations always compose with each other, any program in Cation\n  evaluates to just a single natural transformation, i.e. program compilation is equal to the process of evaluating all\n  expressions.\n\nOn the high level, the Cation program consists of (optionally annotated) statements, which can be either\nspecifiers or expressions.\nSpecifiers are evaluated by the compiler to sets of expressions, serving the primary purpose of reducing boilerplate\ncode and simplifying human readability and writability of the language.\nSpecifiers\nSpecifiers consist of a declaration, optionally followed by a definition, which may contain type and\nbody information. Definition bodies, when present, are made of a sequence of statements.\nDeclaration starts with one of keywords, either build-in (data, fx, infx, let, alias) or added as language\nextensions by domain-specific languages on top of Cation (like Contractum). The declaration keyword is followed by\na declaration name, which can be used later as a part of expressions throughout Cation code.\nThe overall structure of a specifier is the following: &lt;KEYWORD&gt; &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt;? &lt;BODY&gt;?. Type, when present, is\nseparated from the name with a semicolon operator; body, when present, is separated from the previous parts either with\n:= operator, when a body is given on the same line, or a newline character, with all body statements indented.\n\n  Declaration name can be any valid Unicode string; however, it must always start with a non-numeric character, must not\n  contain any already defined names made of math operators (for instance some+method would be an invalid\n  name if the name + was defined before with some other meaning) and must put names made with math\n  operators in backquotes.\n\nSome examples of specifiers are:\n\ndata type specifier:\nwhere data Coord2D is a data type declaration, separated with colon from the type information,\nwhich is x U64, y U64. Data type specifiers contain no body.\nvalue specifier:\nwhere val value is a value declaration, separated with colon from the type information, which is U8. Next,\nthe body contains the value assigned to the named value instance. Value specifications may have data type omitted in\nsituations when it can be inferred; for instance, we can also write the specifier above as val value := 5#U8, where\n#U8 is a type annotation.\n\n\n\nfunction specifier (infix variant):\nwhich can be also written as a one-liner\n\n\n\n  Here we can see several things:\n  \n    declaration name use mathematical symbol of addition and thus backquoted;\n    type information consists of input and return type, separated with -&gt; operator.\n  \n\nExpressions\nEverything which is not a specifier is an expression. Expressions can be seen as mathematical statements, or a natural\ntransformations.\nIn Cation, data types, values and functions are all first-class citizens, such that all of them may participate\nexpressions.\nExpressions are made of named entities, composed together according to the compatibility rules using functions.\nExpressions are separated either with a line feed character (U+000A), or with a semicolon ; if put on one line one\nafter the other.\nLanguage syntax\nFundamental operators\nBuilt-in operators are called fundamental operators. They are used for basic expression composability and constitute\na backbone of the expression syntax.\n\n  Operator is a function which name is made of mathematical symbols.\n  Below we will discuss more about fundamental\n  operators which are a backbone of the expression syntax.\n\nThere are three sets of fundamental operators: categorical limits, projection and injection operators, iterating and\ncomposition operators. These operators are used to structure execution flow: branching, looping, working with\ncollections etc.\nCategorical limits\nThere are two fundamental operators defining categorical limits: product operator , (comma) and sum operator\n| (pipe). These operators are used to compose most of the code; for instance, arguments of a data type definition is\njust an expression composing other data types as a categorical product; for instance, data Coord2D: x U32, y U32\nmakes 2D coordinate as a product of two 32-bit integers. Likewise, a co-product (enum) data types can be defined as\ndata Maybe: none | some(X).\nProjection operators\nProjection operators &nbsp; (space) and . (dot) allow to call a function providing it with arguments. The use of these\ntwo forms depends on the function type and a number of its arguments. There are two types of functions, which affect the\noperator: prefix functions (declared using fx keyword) and infix functions (declared with infx keyword). For prefix\noperators one calls a function (i.e. does projection) by putting function argument after the function name, separating\nthem with a space: someFn argument. In fact, any prefix function can be seen as a function with just a single argument,\nmade of anonymous data type, composing all arguments together. Thus, a function of two arguments can be used in the\nfollowing manner:\n\nAs one may see, a data type can be seen as a function constructing an instance of that type, which emphasises that in\nCation there is no difference between data types and functions.\nThe call of the prefix function can be reversed using a dot projection operator .: coord.twoArgsFn.\nInfix functions are put after their first argument, which allows more natural way of using mathematical operators and\nalike. For instance, above we have declared infx `+`  operator which takes two arguments and adds them together:\na + b. One may also reverse the order of the arguments passed to the infix operator by putting the call expression\ninto parentheses: (+ a, b) or even (+) a, b.\n\n  One may notice that Cation language logo is made with (+) expression :)\n\nInjection operators\nInjection operators &gt;|, |?, |: represent a way how to de-compose a categorical co-product into one of its source\ncomponents and pattern-match against them. In other words, injection operators are the way to branch the code execution;\nthey are the way how if-else statements and pattern matching is handled in the language.\nThere are several ways of doing branching constructions using injection operators. First, one can use value &gt;| in\ncombination with pattern =&gt; code expressions to match the value against a set of patterns and handle a default variant\nwith _ =&gt; code:\n\n  We use `=&gt;` operator to signify that each pattern is in fact a natural transformation\n\n\n\n  In comments we provide Rust equivalents\n\nNext, one can use a boolean expression followed with |? to express if semantics, and use |: for handling else\ncondition. Let's assume we have an expression test which results in a boolean value, and two expressions, ifTrue and\nifFalse which we'd like to execute basing on the test value. To do so we simply write test |? ifTrue |: ifElse.\n\n  Boolean type in Cation is a co-product type, thus any boolean condition can use injection for conditional branching\n  One may clearly see similarities with ternary operator  .. ? .. : ..  &nbsp;in C++; however, in Cation\n  the operator clearly maintains similarity with co-product categorical composition operator | and\n  signifies injections of the co-product value into each of its components.\n\n\nComposition operators\nOperators ( ), [ ] and { } are called composition operators; they are used to create types via categorical\ncomposition of existing types, i.e. act as natural transformations defining new functors (as type constructors) from\nexisting ones.\nRound parenthesis can be used for grouping expressions, such that the boundaries of composition operation are\nexplicitly provided. When used with no values, they also can be used to represent initial object (unit) (,), as\nwell as terminal object (impossible type) (|).\n\n  (,) is the initial object in the category $\\mathbf{Cation}$ of all Cation data types. It corresponds to\n  *unit* type in other languages, like () in Rust or void in C/C++. (|) is the\n  terminal object corresponding to *never* type or *uninhabited* enums in other languages, like ! or\n  enum Impossible {} in Rust.\n\nSquare brackets are used for creating ordered non-unique collection types. Collection type is a type composed\ndynamically (via production operation) of some elementary data types – which in other languages is called a list\nor an array. Finally, curly braces are used for creating ordered unique collection types – sets and maps.\nIn the type definition each of the collection types is required to have a specification of the minimum and maximum\nallowed number of elements – a mechanism by which compiler can perform a termination analysis and enforce boundaries\nand compile-time. This is done with power operator ^ and range operators ..= and ..&lt;. Power operator\ndenotes that the data type of collection element is potentiated, and the range operator specifies limits of how\nmany times the self-product of the element type may happen. For instance, [ U8 ^ ..&lt;256 ] is an array which may\ncontain from zero up to 255 elements of unsigned 8-bit integer type.\nIterating operators\nIterating operators are used not just for data type specifications, but also for enabling code repetitions\n(cycles and loops), iterators and generators. For this purpose iterating operators &lt;| and |&gt; are used.\nThe semantic meaning of the expression becomes take each element of a collection and bring it as a value to the other\nexpression. The collection for &lt;| should be put right-side and expression processing its values left-side,\nwhile for |&gt; the order is reversed. Thus, 0..&lt;100#U8 |&gt; print will iterate over range of unsigned 8-bit integers\nfrom zero to 100 and print each of them. When the iterating operator is combined with a composition operator, this means\nput the resulting values from the expression into a new collection: for instance [0..&lt;100#U8 |&gt; pow 2] would\ncollect all squared numbers from 0 to 99 into a new list.\n\n  In Cation a function and an operator may have multiple aliases. For instance, mathematical and fundamental\n  operators have an ASCII and Unicode aliases, and both can be used in code. For iterating operators, Unicode\n  version is |&gt;, while ASCII is \n  |&gt;\n\nWhen working with loops using iterating operators one may need to access the current value from the iterator in explicit\nform, as well as to use a results from previous rounds of the iterator. This can be done with _ and $ operators:\n_ is the context-defined value operator holding the current input for the iteration, while $ is the result\noperator giving access to the output values of the previous iterations. For instance, to access the previous\nresult one needs to write $-1, and to access the value result of the very first iteration, $0 ($1 will give\nresult of the second iteration etc.). Result operator $ can be also used to assign an output of the iteration or a\nfunction by writing $ &lt;- value.\nTags and annotations\nOperator # adds context tags to the values; for instance it is used to add integer tag to co-product type variants\n(like in data Bool: false#0 | true#1) or to enforce some literal to be of a specific data type (like in ..100#U8,\nwhere the range is enforced to be over U8 type).\nOperator @ is used to annotate Cation statements. Annotations are a way of metaprogramming: they are similar to\nprocedural macros in Rust or annotations in Java.\nData types\nData types are made with GADT and category theory:\n\nprimitive data types all are countable and finite sets;\ncompositional data types are products (using , operator) or coproducts (| operator) of primitive types (sets).\n\nData type names are capitalized; their definition starts with a data keyword, followed by the type name and\ncompositional semantic after a colon, which can be seen as a constructor definition or as a product/coproduct\nfunctor over categories creating new given data type as a new category. For instance, data Coord : x U32, y U32\ndefines category $Coord$ (2D coordinate) as a self-product of categories $U32$ (all 32-bit natural numbers)\n$Coord = U32 \\times U32$ having two corresponding projective morphisms $x: Coord \\mapsto U32$ and $y: Coord \\mapsto U32$\nCation comes with a very small set of built-in data types; the most of the types used in everyday programming are\ndefined in the standard library.\nBuilt-in types\nThere are four main classes of built-in types:\n\n  You can learn more about type classes below\n\n\nunit (,) and never type (|), which we have covered above;\ninteger numbers: signed, unsigned and non-zero unsigned(type classes int, unsigned, signed and nonzero);\nfloating-point numbers (type class float);\nUnicode character Char type;\nrange types.\n\n\n  Unicode character type Char is the only type having variable bit length, which is caused by the\n  Unicode standard. Its length varies from 8 bits to 32 bits; with 8 bit step.\n\nIntegers and floats offer many times with different bit length; float types also offer different memory encodings.\nUnicode character has variable bit length.\nSupported bit length for integer types are:\nBitsBytesUnsignedSignedNon-zeroC equivalentsRust equivalents *\n8 bits1 byteU8I8N8(unsigned) charu8, i8, NonZeroU8\n16 bits2 bytesU16I16N16(unsigned) shortu16, i16, NonZeroU16\n24 bits3 bytesU24I24N24n/an/a\n32 bits4 bytesU32I32N32(unsigned) longu32, i32, NonZeroU32\n40 bits5 bytesU40I40N40n/an/a\n48 bits6 bytesU48I48N48n/an/a\n56 bits7 bytesU56I56N56n/an/a\n64 bits8 bytesU64I64N64(unsigned) long longu64, i64, NonZeroU64\n80 bits10 bytesU80I80N80n/an/a\n96 bits12 bytesU96I96N96n/an/a\n112 bits14 bytesU112I112N112n/an/a\n128 bits16 bytesU128I128N128n/au128, i128, NonZeroU128\n256 bits32 bytesU256I256N256n/an/a\n512 bits64 bytesU512I512N512n/an/a\n1024 bits128 bytesU1024I1024N1024n/an/a\n\n\n  &nbsp;\n  * Rust amplify library offers many of the integer\n  types present in the Cation language\n\nAll integer types in Cation are co-product types, made with all their allowed values. This makes it possible to use\ninjection operators to match them against patterns and ranges.\nSupported bit length and encodings for floating-point types are:\nType nameBytesEncodingUnderlynig Rust type\nF16B2bfloat16bfloat::bf16\nF162IEEE Halfapfloat::ieee::Half\nF324IEEE Singleapfloat::ieee::Single\nF648IEEE Doubleapfloat::ieee::Double\nF8010IEEE X87 Extendedapfloat::ieee::X87DoubleExtended\nF12816IEEE Quadapfloat::ieee::Quad\nF25632IEEE Octapfloat::ieee::Oct\n\nRange types simplify creation of collection types, described below, as well as are an\nefficient tool in building cycles and iterators. Cation comes with the following set of\nrange types, each of which can be instantiated using a shorthand range operator.\nType nameRange operator\nRangeAll..\nRangeTo..&lt;N\nRangeToIncl..=N\nRangeFromM..\nRangeFromToM..&lt;N\nRangeFromToInclM..=N\n\nData type composition\nNew data types in Cation are constructed via composition of built-in types using categorical product and co-product\noperators , and | described above. Here are the requirements for the syntax of these operators:\nNameSyntax formMax no of fields or variants\nProduct types (structure, tuple)• , • or (• , •)256\nSum types (union, enum)• | • or (• | •)256\n\nIterable collections\nOne may use composition operators to build arrays and dynamic collections, which may be\niterated over using iterating operations. Cation provides built-in support for the following\ncollections:\nNameSyntax formMax no of elements / fields / variants\nFixed array[•^N]N, up to 2^16\nDynamic list[• ^D..&lt;U]From D to U, up to 2^64\nDynamic set{• ^D..&lt;U}From D to U, up to 2^64\nDynamic map{• -&gt; ^D..U •}From D to U, up to 2^64\n\nRange constriction ^D..=U used in type expression specifying minimum and maximum size of a dynamic collection is\ncalled confinement bounds. It can be seen as an upper and lower indexes on the possible number of elements, i.e.\ntype definition [Byte ^ 1..20] can be read as $\\bigotimes^{20}_1 byte$ and means product type with dynamic number of\nfields, from 1 to 20 max, where each field is a byte – or, in more common terms, a byte array of dynamic size which\ncan't have less than one byte – and can't grow larger than 20 bytes.\nFor simplifying syntax strict encoding provides comprehensions and defaults for specifying the confinement bounds:\nComprehensionExpands toComment\n[•][• ^ 0..=0xFFFF]Default number of elements in confined collections is from zero to 2^16\n[•+] or [•^1..][• ^ 1..=0xFFFF]Collection which must contain at least one item\n[•^N][• ^ N..=0xFFFF]Collection with minimum of N items\n[•^..=N][• ^ 0..=N]Collection having maximum of N items\n\n\n  Please note that type expression of [•^N..=N] is not allowed, since it means dynamic collection\n  with a fixed number of items, which is nonsense, so please use [•^N] instead.\n\nStandard library types\nStandard library offers many types composed of the built-ins, including (but not limiting to):\n\nRestricted-bit-length integers, like U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6, U7;\nASCII char subsets AsciiChar, AsciiPrintable and others;\nStrings: Unicode strings String, ASCII string AsciiString;\nBytes, fixed and dynamic byte arrays: Byte, Bytes16, Bytes32, Blob256, Blob64kB, Blob16MB Blob4GB etc;\nCommonly-used monads Maybe, Either, Result, Ternary.\n\nLambda expressions\nLambda expressions allow a combination of statements, capturing locally-defined values,\nto be treated as a function. They simplify passing functions as arguments to other functions, saving\nfrom boilerplate code.\n\n  One of Cation's main features is an ability to treat data, values and functions the same way, making all of them\n  first-class citizens.\n\nLambda expressions have several forms. The canonical one is a specifier form, which starts with a lambda keyword,\nfollowed by a value name, colon, argument and return type definition and body:\n\nAs any other specifier it can be put into a single line:\n\nThe second form is an operator form using .\\ or Greek λ; it allows anonymous lambda definitions which may span\na single or multiple lines. The specific syntax of this form depends on whether the lambda is the last expression in\nthe line:\n\n  The .\\ operator is shaped after Greek letter $\\lambda$.\n\n\nIf a lambda expression has to be followed by other expressions, one need to put the expression into a parenthesis:\n\nLambda expressions may have own explicit arguments, separated from the function body using double-column. The return\ntype may be omitted, and in this case if is inferred by the compiler from the body of the expression:\n\nFinally, there is the multiline forms of lambda expressions:\n\nIn can be used the same way as single-line expressions, with the only difference – there is no colon between the lambda\ndeclaration and the body:\n\nThe type of the lambda expression is .\\ input -&gt; output, and this type may be used in type annotations:\n\n\nGenerics\nCation supports parametric polymorphism via type classes, generics and confinement constraints.\nType classes\nType classes are the same as classes in Haskell or traits in Rust: they provide a simple way to introduce generics into\nprogramming, without the need for complex inheritance rules.\nType classes are declared with class keyword followed by a lowercase name; here is an example how ord and eq\nclasses are defined in the standard library:\n\n\n  Cation tries to use semantically and mathematically correct operator symbols. Thus, instead of using simple\n  &gt; operator, which states that the left value is greater than one, we add a question mart to it,\n  applying semantic of test.\n\nWith declarations, all types which has infix &gt;? operator taking two arguments of the same type and returning bool\nwill become ord and acquire the opposite infix operator &lt;?.\nGeneric arguments\nFunctions and data types can be equipped with generic arguments between colon separating function name from its input\narguments, and =&gt; character:\n\n  In terms of category theory, generic arguments represent a co-product of all generic types, and `=&gt;` operator is a\n  natural transformation from the functor constructing that co-product to the function itself as a functor mapping\n  category of its composed input type to category of its composed output type.\n\n\nEach generic argument consists of generic parameter name – usually capitalized – and a constraint expressed as a\ntype class name to which the type must belong. Multiple generic parameters should be separated by a comma.\nConfinement constraints\nWhen collections are used inside functions sometimes it is important to make sure that the concrete collection types\nprovided to the function in different input or output arguments match their dimensions. This is achieved with a\nspecial form of generics named confinement constrains:\n\n  Confinement constraints make Cation to fully support generalized algebraic data types (GADT) and ensure at\n  compile-time absence of stack overflows and out-of-memory bounds access\n\n\nComputational parallelism\nCation compiler will be designed to reason about the code logic at compile-time, which is possible due to constraints\nand bounds on all resources used by the language. During compilation, it deduces the graph of all relations between\nvalues used in the program, and uses that graph to automatically parallelize all computations which do not access the\nsame values at the same time. Thus, most of the parallelism will come for free, with no effort from the programmer.\nWhen an explicit parallelism is needed, Cation offers channel-based parallelism, made with rho-calculus. Thus, instead\nof a need to differentiate async and non-async functions one uses non-blocking channels to send data by value. Since\nthere is no difference between data, types, functions and everything is just a natural transformations, channels can\nsend also functions between threads. This significantly simplifies programming patterns and reduces the number of\npossible pitfalls,\n\n  Specific syntax for channel-based concurrency programming and computational parallelism is still work in progress\n\nLanguage comparison\nThe main differences between Cation and other modern programming languages with strong functional properties are given\nin the table:\nLanguageAbsent in the language(but present in Cation)Features used in Cation\nHaskellTermination analysis, parallel computing, GADT, \"infinite types\", absence of runtimeMonads\nIdris v2Parallel computing, absence of runtimeGADT, termination analysis, monads, eager evaluation\nScala v2Termination analysis, absence of runtime, types are not first-class citizensGADT, eager evaluation, monads\nRustTermination analysis, parallel computing, GADT, types are not first-class citizensNo runtime\n\n","id":"https://cation-lang.org/design/","title":""},"https://cation-lang.org/examples/":{"body":"Cation Language Examples\nExample programs\nFibonacci numbers\n\nor, as a shortened one-liner:\n\nHello world\n\nUse of specific statements\nData type definitions\n\nUsing generics:\n\nFunctions\n\nCode branching\n\nCollections and ranges\n\nIterators\n\nCollection comprehensions\n\nMonadic operators\n\nType classes\n\n","id":"https://cation-lang.org/examples/","title":""},"https://cation-lang.org/overview/":{"body":"Cation Language Overview\nCation as a pure categorical programming language for practical tasks.\nWe designed Cation to be:\n\nnon-verbose;\nas close to mathematics notation as possible;\nextensible and usable for creation of domain-specific languages.\n\nUnique features\nBoundness\nCation is the first and the only language where all types are bounded in their size and computational resources at the\ncompile time. This enables two main core language properties: formal verifiability and termination analysis. It\nalso makes Cation a language which can be used for writing ubiquitous deterministic programs suitable for mathematical\nmodelling and immutable smart contracts.\n\nWhy not to use existing functional language?\nSince each one of them lacks the distinguishing features: absence of the non-terminating computations and parallelism\nby default.\nInstead of operating with a pure mathematical abstractions, which may frequent lead to paradoxes with no physical\nmeaning (like Banach–Tarski paradox),\nCation assumes real physical model for the computing: there are no infinities; any computation is always bound in its\nresources. This allows Cation to achieve things which can't be achieved with any other existing language,\nfunctional or not.\n\nBy types being bound we mean that any type is a finite set of a known size, with all possible values known to the\ncompiler.\n\nOnly two foundational types: unit (initial object) and uninhabitable type (empty set or a terminal object);\nAll integers are enumerations made with unit type (Peano arithmetics);\nAll rational numbers, including rational numbers (like results of division of integers),\narithmetic reals (like square root of 2) and irrational numbers (like pi or e) are explicit\ndecimal approximates expressed as functions running for a number of steps known at compile-time;\nAll other types are composed as a product or co-product categories from unit and uninhabitable type;\nDynamic collections and iterators always have bounds on the minimum and maximal number of elements enforced at\ncompile-time;\nThere is no bottom type (non-terminating computations).\n\nParallelism by default\nCation compiller converts a program as a set of expressions into a composition of natural transformations. This allows\nstatic analysis at compile-time of which branches of computations depends on which values from other branches; the\ncompiler uses this information to parallize all computing wherever is possible with no programmer or syntax overhead.\nWhen needed, a developer can use an explicit parallelism using asynchronous channels, avoiding racing conditions. These\nchannels can be used to send values, lambda-functions and even other channels between execution threads using\nrho-calculus: an extension of lambda-calculus for parallel computations.\nNo RAM, no mutability\n\nAbsence of mutable variables;\nAbstracted memory management: language is suitable for architectures with no RAM access, like memristors and cellular\nautomation;\n\nNotable features\n\nGeneric system\nCollections\nIterators\nCollection comprehensions\nExtensible set of literals\nDomain-specific languages\nNo runtime\nTiny set of compiler built-ins\nMoands\nSide-effect control\nTermination analysis\nExtensible infix operators\nClose-to-mathematics\n\nSyntax\nDeclarations\nCation has only two keywords: type, for defining a type, and val, for instantiating a value.\n","id":"https://cation-lang.org/overview/","title":""},"https://cation-lang.org/reference/":{"body":"Cation Language Reference\nLexical structure\nThe lexical structure of Cation describes what sequence of characters form valid tokens of the language. These valid\ntokens form the lowest-level building blocks of the language and are used to describe the rest of the language in\nsubsequent chapters. A token consists of an identifier, keyword, punctuation, literal, or operator.\nIn most cases, tokens are generated from the characters of a Cation source file by considering the longest possible\nsubstring from the input text, within the constraints of the grammar that are specified below. This behavior is referred\nto as longest match or maximal munch.\nWhitespace and comments\nWhitespace has three uses:\n\nto separate tokens in the source file;\nto separate statements with indentation;\nto distinguish between prefix and infix operators (see Operators);\n\nThe following characters are considered whitespace: space (U+0020), line feed (U+000A), carriage return (U+000D),\nhorizontal tab (U+0009), vertical tab (U+000B), form feed (U+000C) and null (U+0000).\nComments are treated as whitespace by the compiler. Single line comments begin with -- and continue until a line feed\n(U+000A) or carriage return (U+000D). Multiline comments begin with {- and end with -}. Nesting multiline comments\nis allowed, but the comment markers must be balanced.\nIdentifiers\nIdentifiers begin with an uppercase or lowercase letter A through Z, an underscore (_), a noncombining alphanumeric\nUnicode character in the Basic Multilingual Plane, or a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane that isn’t in\na Private Use Area. After the first character, digits and combining Unicode characters are also allowed.\nTo use ASCII punctuation characters in an identifier, or a reserved word, put a backtick (`) before and after it.\nFor example, data isn’t a valid identifier, but `data` is valid. The backticks aren’t considered part of the\nidentifier; `x` and x has the same meaning.\nKeywords\nThe following keywords are reserved and can’t be used as identifiers, unless they’re escaped with backticks, as\ndescribed above in Identifiers. Keywords other than let and lambda can be used as field or variant\nnames in data types, as parameter names in a function declaration or function call without being escaped with backticks.\n\ndata: defines new data type\nclass: defines a new data type class\nfx: defines new function (prefix function)\ninfx: defines new infix function\nlambda: defines a lambda function\nalias: defines a new alias for a function\nlet: defines new value\n\nThe following tokens are reserved as built-in operators and can’t be used in custom operators: (, ), {, },\n[, ], ., ,, :, ;, #, =&gt;, -&gt;, &lt;-, &lt;|, |&gt;, &gt;|, |?, |:, .\\, `.\nLiterals\nA literal is the source code representation of a value of a type, such as a number or string.\nThe following are examples of literals:\n\nA literal without a tag doesn’t have a type on its own. Instead, Cation’s type inference attempts to infer\na type for the literal. For example, in the declaration let x: U8 := 42, Cation uses the explicit type information\n(: U8) to infer that the type of the integer literal 42 is U8. If there isn’t suitable type information available,\nCation infers that the literal’s type is one of the default literal built-in Cation types listed in the table below.\nLiteralDefault type\nIntegerU64\nFloatF64\nCharacterChar\nStringString\n\nWhen specifying the type annotation for a literal value with a tag, the annotation’s type must be a type that can be\ninstantiated from that literal value.\nFor example, in the declaration let str := \"Hello, world\", the default inferred type of the string literal\n\"Hello, world\" is String. This can be changed by using type annotation or tag: both\nlet str: AsciiString := \"Hello, world\" and let str := \"Hello, world\"#AsciiString will be inferred to AsciiString\ntype instead of String.\nInteger literals\nInteger literals represent integer values of some precision. By default, integer literals are expressed in\ndecimal; you can specify an alternate base using a prefix:\n\nbinary literals begin with 0b,\noctal literals begin with 0o,\nand hexadecimal literals begin with 0x.\n\nDecimal literals contain the digits 0 through 9. Binary literals contain 0 and 1, octal literals contain 0 through 7,\nand hexadecimal literals contain 0 through 9 as well as A through F in upper- or lowercase.\nNegative integers literals are expressed by prepending a minus sign (-) to an integer literal, as in -42.\nUnderscores (_) are allowed between digits for readability, but they’re ignored and therefore don’t affect the value of\nthe literal. Integer literals can begin with leading zeros (0), but they’re likewise ignored and don’t affect the base\nor value of the literal.\nUnless otherwise specified, the default inferred type of an integer literal is the Cation built-in type U64.\nCation has built-in types for various sizes of signed, unsigned and built-in integers, as described in\nIntegers.\nFloating-point literals\nFloating-point literals represent floating-point values of some precision.\nBy default, floating-point literals are expressed in decimal (with no prefix), but they can also be expressed in\nhexadecimal (with a 0x prefix).\nDecimal floating-point literals consist of a sequence of decimal digits followed by either a decimal fraction, a decimal\nexponent, or both. The decimal fraction consists of a decimal point (.) followed by a sequence of decimal digits. The\nexponent consists of an upper- or lowercase e prefix followed by a sequence of decimal digits that indicates what\npower of 10 the value preceding the e is multiplied by. For example, 1.25e2 represents 1.25 x 10², which evaluates\nto 125.0. Similarly, 1.25e-2 represents 1.25 x 10⁻², which evaluates to 0.0125.\nHexadecimal floating-point literals consist of a 0x prefix, followed by an optional hexadecimal fraction, followed by a\nhexadecimal exponent. The hexadecimal fraction consists of a decimal point followed by a sequence of hexadecimal digits.\nThe exponent consists of an upper- or lowercase p prefix followed by a sequence of decimal digits that indicates what\npower of 2 the value preceding the p is multiplied by. For example, 0xFp2 represents 15 x 2², which evaluates to 60.\nSimilarly, 0xFp-2 represents 15 x 2⁻², which evaluates to 3.75.\nNegative floating-point literals are expressed by prepending a minus sign (-) to a floating-point literal, as in -42.5.\nUnderscores (_) are allowed between digits for readability, but they’re ignored and therefore don’t affect the value\nof the literal. Floating-point literals can begin with leading zeros (0), but they’re likewise ignored and don’t\naffect the base or value of the literal.\nUnless otherwise specified, the default inferred type of a floating-point literal is the Cation built-in F64, which\nrepresents a 64-bit floating-point number.\nCharacter literal\nString literals\nBinary data literals\nDate-and-time literals\nCustom literals\nSyntactic constructs\nSpecifiers\nProjections\nFunction calls are made using projection operator expressed as a space ( ); i.e. for a prefix function fn the way\nto call it is to write fn args, where args can be a named or unnamed data type matching arguments in the function\ndeclaration. They can be kapt in (..), or without them, but if multiple arguments are present they must be separated\nfrom each other with a comma , (product operator which composes arguments into a data type). Thus, a function always\ntakes a single argument, which can be a named or unnamed data type.\nPrefix functions may be called using an infix notation: (args).fn, or via arg0.fn arg1, .., argLast notation.\nCall of an infix function infn is arg0 infn arg1, .., argLast. It can be reverted via use of\n(infn arg0, .., argLast) or (infn) arg0, .., argLast forms.\nInjections\nInjections are branching operators, which allow code execution to branch execution basing on a value of a co-product\ntype. They are either pattern matching (an equivalent of Rust match and Haskell case), or a boolean-test based.\nPattern matching is done with &gt;| infix operator, which takes a value of a co-product type on the left side, and a\nset of natural transformations matching each of the injections on the right:\n\nBranching based on the boolean conditions uses .. |? .. |: .. operator, which is also a ternary operator,\ncorresponding to if .. then .. else construction. It also has a form of\ncondition1 |? statement1 |: condition2 |? statement2 |: statementElse, corresponding to\nif condition1 then statement1 elseIf condition2 then statement2 else statementElse.\nAnnotations\nOperators\nBuilt-in\nCategorical limits\nOperator , is a categorical product operator. Operator | is categorical sum operator\nMappings (morphisms and functors)\nOperators -&gt; &lt;- define functors: they do project an object or each of\nobjects in a category (value, collection, iterator or a data type) to a\ndifferent object or a category.\nFor instance, when used in function definition, it projects all possible\nvalues of a function input as data type (which may be a composite anonymous\ntype) to the set of return values defined by the return data type:\n\nOperator -&gt; is also used inside collections of key-value maps, separating\nkeys and their corresponding values.\nNatural transformation mapping\nOperator =&gt; is used to introduce generic arguments as a natural transformation.\nIteration operators\nOperators |&gt; and &lt;| used to build iterators: it maps of the items\nof an iterable collection into a new value:\n\nwhich will result in a new iterator over doubled values in the range from\n0 to 99.\nOne may skip te initial x &lt;- assignment; in this case the input value of\nthe current iteration will be put into the first argument of the next expression:\n\none may also use the context operator _:\n\nor reverse the order of the expressions:\n\nLambda operator\nLambda operator .\\, with alias λ (Greek letter lambda) is a shorthand for creating lambda expressions.\nIt has four forms:\n\nsingle-line, end of line (trailing lambda):\n\nsingle-line, alongside other expressions:\n\nmulti-line, end of line (trailing lambda block):\n\nmulti-line, alongside other expressions:\n\n\nAll forms may skip the return type -&gt; ret part; in this case the return type is inferred by the compiler:\n\nIf the lambda expression has no inputs, lambda operator must be simply followed by the expression itself with no\ncolon used:\n\nSee also lambda specifier.\nStandard library\nMonadic operators\nOperators !, !!, ? and ?? are used with monad types (like\noptionals/maybes or result types). First, ! and ? marks a part of the\nexpression which should be tested against unwrapped monad value; if the unwrap\nprocedure fails, it will default to the expression put after !! or ??\noperator at the end of the same line. For instance, if value is of Maybe\ntype we can write value ?? 0; or value !! noValue; the first will default\nexpression to zero, and the second convert return type of the function to a\nresult type, create an enum Error with variant noValue and will return\nthat value if the maybe monad in value doesn't contain an actual value.\nArithmetic operators\nUnlike other languages, Cation requires to explicitly handle overflow and underflow conditions in arithmetics, as well\nas zero divisions, which is required for termination analysis and helps in avoiding undefined behaviours. Thus, each of\narithmetic operators has multiple forms, handling overflows and underflows differently. This approach used in Cation\nis named checked arithmetics.\nTo construct arithmetic operators, a symbol representing mathematical operation (like +, -, *, /, %, ^) is\npostfixed with a symbol representing the way of handling overflow, underflow or zero divisions. Such symbols are:\n\n? for converting the result of the operation into Maybe monad;\n! for converting the result of the operation into Result::error monad variant with details on specific condition\nwhich has occurred;\n% for wrapping a value in case of overflow (modulo-arithmetic) and returning ArRes monad;\n^ for saturating a value with a maximum possible value in case of overflow;\nwith no postfix for extending the result type to the next bit dimension so it always fits.\n\nAdditionally, Cation allows native arithmetic operations when an operation itself and the resulting type\nguarantees impossibility of overflow or other exceptional conditions. These operations are:\n\nunsigned, signed and non-zero integer addition with + operator, when the bit dimension of the resulting integer type\nis equal to or exceeds the sum of the bit dimensions of the inputs;\nsigned integer subtraction with - operator, when the bit dimension of the resulting integer type is equal to or\nexceeds the sum of the bit dimensions of the inputs;\nunsigned, signed and non-zero integer multiplication with * operator, when the dimension of the resulting integer\ntype is equal to or exceeds the product of the bit dimensions of the inputs;\ndivision with / operator of non-zero unsigned integers;\nmodulo division with % operator of non-zero unsigned integers;\nunsigned, signed and non-zero potentiation with ^ operator when the bit dimensions of the resulting integer type\nexceeds\n\nThus, the resulting table of the arithmetic operations is the following:\nOperationNativeMaybeResultWrappingSaturatingExtending\nAddition++?+!+%+^+\nSubtraction--?-!-%-^-\nMultiplication**?*!*%*^*\nDivision//?/!n/an/an/a\nModulo division%%?%!n/an/an/a\nPotentiation^^?^!^%^^^\n\nBitwise operators\nBoolean logic operators\nTernary logic operators\nString operators\nTypes\nBuilt-in\nInitial and terminal\nIntegers\nIntegers come in signed, unsigned and non-zero unsigned classes, each of which contains types with different bit length.\nSupported bit length for integer types are:\nBitsBytesUnsignedSignedNon-zeroC equivalentsRust equivalents\n8 bits1 byteU8I8N8(unsigned) charu8, i8, NonZeroU8\n16 bits2 bytesU16I16N16(unsigned) shortu16, i16, NonZeroU16\n24 bits3 bytesU24I24N24n/an/a\n32 bits4 bytesU32I32N32(unsigned) longu32, i32, NonZeroU32\n40 bits5 bytesU40I40N40n/an/a\n48 bits6 bytesU48I48N48n/an/a\n56 bits7 bytesU56I56N56n/an/a\n64 bits8 bytesU64I64N64(unsigned) long longu64, i64, NonZeroU64\n80 bits10 bytesU80I80N80n/an/a\n96 bits12 bytesU96I96N96n/an/a\n112 bits14 bytesU112I112N112n/an/a\n128 bits16 bytesU128I128N128n/au128, i128, NonZeroU128\n256 bits32 bytesU256I256N256n/an/a\n512 bits64 bytesU512I512N512n/an/a\n1024 bits128 bytesU1024I1024N1024n/an/a\n\nAll integer types in Cation are co-product types, made with all their allowed values.

Its length varies from 8 bits to 32 bits; with 8 bit step.\nRanges\nRange types simplify creation of collection types, as well as are an efficient tool for\ncycles and iterators.
